**AWS DVA - C02**

**AWS Cloud Overview**:

Factors affect choosing an AWS Region:
1. Compliance with data governance and legal requirements - data never leaves a region without permission.
2. Proximity to customers: reduces latency
3. Available services: not every new service  is available in every region	
4. Pricing: varies from region to region

AZs: each region has usually 3 AZs, 
- Each AZ is one or more data centers with redundant power, connectivity and network.
- Separate from each other, so isolated from disaster.
- They are connected with high bandwidth and ultra low latency.

Edge Locations: Points of Presence
- Content is delivered to end users using low latency.

# Section 4: IAM & AWS CLI

IAM  - Identity and Access Management, Global Service.

Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared.
- Instead create users, users are people within your org, and can be grouped.
- Groups only contain user, cannot contain other groups.
    - Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups
